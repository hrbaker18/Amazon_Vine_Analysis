# Amazon Vine Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis was to determine whether there was the potential for any bias in Amazon's Vine Review program, specifically towards those who write favorable reviews. 

For this analysis, the <b>Giftcard</b> dataset was used. 

## Results

After performing an analysis of the Giftcard dataset, the following results were determind:

1. Total number of reviews: 355
2. Number of 5-star reviews with the Vine program: 0
3. Number of 5-star reviews unaffiliated with the Vine program: 90
4. Percentage of 5-star reviews for Vine program: 0%
5. Percentage of 5-star reviews for non-Vine program: 25.25%

## Summary 

As shown the in the above analysis, all 5-star reviews for Giftcards were left by people unaffiliated with the Vine program. Furthermore, there are only a total of 355 reviews. Based on the results of this analysis, there does not appear to be a bias in favor of the Vine program, however, with only 355 total reviews, more data is needed to be sure. 

### For Further Consideration

As the only 5-star ratings from this dataset were not affiliated with the Vine program, an analysis should be done comparing the average star rating for Vine and non-Vine affiliates to compare the bulk of the reviews.
